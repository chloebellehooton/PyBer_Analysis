# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

I was tasked to perform exploratory analysis by making visualizations to tell a compelling story. The goal was to use charts to show relationship between type of city and number of drivers and riders. I also took a look at total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. This will help PyBer improve access to services in improve accessibility to underserved areas. By creating visualizations of ride-share data for PyBer it will help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 

In this analysis, I created a summary DataFrame to show ride-sharing data by city type and then showed the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results

- There are far more rides and drivers in Urban cities with Suburban cities coming in second, and Rural having the least. This leads Urban cities having the highest total fares despite having the lowest fare per ride and per driver. There is an inverse relationship between total fares and average fare per ride and driver.

## Summary

- There's a huge disparity in the number of rides, drivers, and fares by city type. Rural areas have very few drivers which is causing higher fares per ride and a low number of rides. If PyBer truly wants to focus on underserved areas, rural would be their next move. 

- However, this might not be the best business decision given how sprawling rural areas can be and the lack of demand shown by the number of rides. This could be due to the lack of supply that is leading to the higher fare per ride, but there also are smaller populations and therefore less opportunity in these rural areas.

- PyBer has been quite successful in the Urban cities and should continue their efforts to expand within this cities as this has been quite lucrative.

- For their next opportunity, PyBer should expand to Suburban areas given they have been able to attain a higher fare per ride and there has been quite a bit of demand. This shouldn't be too difficult given the drivers are being compensated quite well for their efforts compared to the Urban drivers.
