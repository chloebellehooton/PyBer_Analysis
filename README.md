# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

I was tasked to perform exploratory analysis by making visualizations to tell a compelling story. The goal was to use charts to show relationship between type of city and number of drivers and riders. I also took a look at total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. This will help PyBer improve access to services in improve accessibility to underserved areas. By creating visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer it will help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 

In this analysis, I created a summary DataFrame to show ride-sharing data by city type and then showed the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results


There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)
